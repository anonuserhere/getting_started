- Just somewhere to consolidate steps and resources for getting started, putting thoughts to paper and to somewhat allay a personal fear of an unorganized and haphazard fresh setup (new PC, work laptop, lost device ðŸ˜¢, etc.)
- Quick access to bookmarks/references (if you do not want to login on an untrusted terminal for example).
- I'll try to keep this sorted/updated but we all know how chaotic thoughts can be sometimes.
- Do keep in mind that this is just a springboard to get started and these lists are not exhaustive. If you want to go with alternative B instead of A just because you're proficient with it despite A having more features, that's perfectly fine.
- The Internet is your oyster.
