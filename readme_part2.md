In this digital age, there are plenty of online resources available.  
What's more important is trying to understand/apply it correctly as opposed to just copy-pasting although to be fair, there's no shame in that game unless done blindly (maybe I'm trying to convince myself as well, haha).

‚≠ê Important learning points

- "Homework"/Documentation(aka RTFM)  
  Sometimes the solution to the problem you're having might just be in the manual. I'm lazier than you know but even I think it's only fair to read through the "getting started" or FAQs section at the very least.  
  Conversely, authors also need to make sure their documentation is straightforward and easy to understand.  
  Another good trick is to search for the application/library/subject's cheat sheet to get a quick reference.

- Applying critical thinking  
  With AI not being perfect with its responses (yet), it's important to double-check responses as a good practice.  
  This applies to non-AI areas as well.

- "WTF" moments  
  It's important to remember to adapt code for your use case. It may work for the other party but not you (back to the point about blind copy-pasting).
